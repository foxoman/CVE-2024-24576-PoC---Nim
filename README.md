**Exploring Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Windows with Nim**

[READ HERE]: https://foxoman.hashnode.dev/exploring-command-injection-vulnerabilities-in-windows-with-nim?showSharer=true

Here's a summarized table based on the testing results from the Nim code experiments with different payloads:

| Payload                | execProcess_NoQuoteShell | execProcess_QuoteShell | execShellCmd |
|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| `nim &calc`            | Not Passed               | Not Passed             | Passed       |
| `nim" &calc`           | Passed                   | Not Passed             | Not Passed   |
| `%CMDCMDLINE:~-1%&calc`| Passed                   | Passed                 | Passed       |

"Passed" indicates the payload executed in a way that could potentially exploit the BatBadBut vulnerability, demonstrating the nuanced behavior of command execution methods in Nim in response to different types of inputs.
